<h2>My top 3 Animes and Mangas of all time</h2>
<hr>

<h1>MANGA</h1>
<ol>
    <h2><li>BERSERK</li></h2>
    <h3><p>It has great story, with a large amount of different characters with an awesome background and the protagonist (Guts) is my favourite among them.</p></h3>
    <h2><li>CHAINSAW MAN</li></h2>
    <h3><p>Even though the story is a bit strangely written by the author, it has caught my attention also by watching the animation style used by MAPPA Studio in the anime.</p></h3>
    <h2><li>JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURES</li></h2>
    <h3><p>With a great artstyle by the author, Hirohiko Haraki, it is well known across the whole world and it is one of the most famous Mangas and Animes</p></h3>
</ol>

<h1>ANIME</h1>
<ol>
    <h2><li>ATTACK ON TITAN</li></h2>
    <h3><p>Full of great plot-twists and beautifully written story</p></h3>
    <h2><li>JUJUTSU KAISEN</li></h2>
    <h3><p>Great freshly new Anime, firstly saw it a bit late after it came out, just waiting for the new season to come out in 2025</p></h3>
    <h2><li>KENPUU DENKI BERSERK(1997)</li></h2>
